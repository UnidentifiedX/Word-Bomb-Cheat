## Word Bomb Automator
Automation of Roblox's Word Bomb game using computer vision.

### How to use
1. Clone the repository. Or just download the `main.py` and `scrabble_list.txt` files.
2. I used Python 3.11.5, so I recommend you to use the same version.
3. Install `requirements.txt` using the following command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run the program. If it's your first time, required language files will be downloaded.
5. Switch to your word bomb screen and leave it running. It will automatically detect your turns as well as rejoin games when it's over.
6. Press/spam the \` key to end the program. It will take a few seconds to close.
7. You can modify the constants at the top of the `main.py` file to change the behavior of the program.

I made this cause I was bored. Use responsibly. If you found a better image preprocessing method, just make a pr and let me know.
